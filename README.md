# Twitch Chat Toxicity Analysis

I store chat logs from the biggest streamers and then will use the perspective api and potentially my own models to conclude which chats are the most toxic and why

# How to set it up

## Install dependencies
`yarn`

## Run the twitch bot
`yarn start`

Sorry, no npm shills allowed
